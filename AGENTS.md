# Agent Instructions

## Defect Tracking - REQUIRED

**When you find a defect during development or testing**, you MUST:

1. **Write a failing test** that reproduces the defect (TDD)

2. **Fix the defect** with minimal changes

3. **Verify locally**: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test -- --run`

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
2. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
3. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
4. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
5. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
